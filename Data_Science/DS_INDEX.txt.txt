Create Indexes:
Advantage: Usefull when the database contains a hugh amount of data and you have to 
request often data
Disadvantage: The more indexes a table contains the more storage is needed -> the maximum
of storage for a table can be reached faster.
If a table contains a lot of indexes the speed for updating the data loses its efficiency
because the indexes needed to be updated as well.
How a Index work: it works like an index in a book you don't have to go
throug every single page for searching a word you just go to the Index

Query:
CREATE INDEX person_first_name_idx
ON person (first_name;
Example for Running Query:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM person
WHERE first_name = 'Emma';

Multicolumn Index:
CREATE INDEX person_first_name_last_name_idx
ON person (last_name, first_name);
